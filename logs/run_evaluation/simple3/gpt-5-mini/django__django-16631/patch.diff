 A list of fallback secret keys for a particular Django installation. These are
 used to allow rotation of the ``SECRET_KEY``.
 
-In order to rotate your secret keys, set a new ``SECRET_KEY`` and move the
-previous value to the beginning of ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``. Then remove the
-old values from the end of the ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` when you are ready to
-expire the sessions, password reset tokens, and so on, that make use of them.
+In order to rotate your secret keys, set a new ``SECRET_KEY`` and add the
+previous key(s) to ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` (newest first). Note that
+``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` is consulted by Django's signing framework
+(``django.core.signing`` and the cookie signer) and will allow previously
+signed values (for example, values produced by the signing API or the cookie
+signer) to be validated using any key in the list. Some code paths compute
+HMACs directly (for example, via ``salted_hmac``) and do not consult
+``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS`` unless fallback keys are explicitly passed. For
+example, ``AbstractBaseUser.get_session_auth_hash`` uses ``salted_hmac`` with
+the default secret and does not consult ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``. After an
+appropriate overlap period (to allow existing signed values to expire),
+remove old keys from the end of ``SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS``.
