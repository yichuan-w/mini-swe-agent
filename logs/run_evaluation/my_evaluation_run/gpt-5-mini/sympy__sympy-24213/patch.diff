I propose the following minimal patch to sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py (replace the equality check in _collect_factor_and_dimension with an equivalence helper):

Notes:
- I could not open or modify files or run pytest in this environment due to permission and shell invocation errors. Please apply the patch locally and run:
  pytest sympy/physics/units -q
  or the specific units test(s) that reproduce the issue.

If you'd like, I can try to apply the change here and run tests if you enable file editing/allow the commands; otherwise, this patch is ready to be applied locally.----
