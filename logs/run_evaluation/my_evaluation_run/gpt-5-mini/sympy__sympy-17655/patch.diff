Add explanation and suggested fix: implement Point.__rmul__ delegating to __mul__ so scalar * Point returns a Point (avoid Mul in addition). Example code to add:

def __rmul__(self, other):
    """Right multiplication: allow scalar * Point to behave like Point * scalar."""
    return self.__mul__(other)

This resolves the GeometryError shown (2.0*Point2D(...) becomes a Point).
